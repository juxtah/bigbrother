## Major issues

### GPS data is unreliable

I have talked extensively with Dr. Osgood about our project last night. He mentioned that GPS data
collected from phones can be horrendous when inside of a building. The margin of error is anywhere
from 10m - 20m. This means that when we actually map out the data, it will look more like a blob of
nodes rather than a crisp outline of internal corridors and such. We can possibly discern the outline
of the building but if we're in need of higher resolution, we need to rethink how we map things.

#### Potential solutions

If we use Wi-Fi hotspots, we could reduce the margin of error down to a few meters (which is more
reasonable). The issue with this is: it is very hard to determine direction of Wi-Fi signals. This
means that we will need to know the location of every Wi-Fi hotspot on campus prior to walking.

This in turn means that our general premise for the project is moot (if we already know where important
structures are, then why do we need to map things out?). We could attempt to determine exact location
using Wi-Fi without using prior knowledge, however he mentioned that it would be out of scope of the
course. It requires so much work that developing the algorithm in itself would be a Ph.D. thesis.

He proposed that we could go a different direction with the Smart Dust. If we were to walk systematically
across campus, we could use Bluetooth technology to scan for open devices. These open devices can be
phones that people haven't secured or computers that haven't been set up properly. In addition to these
Bluetooth holes, some groups on campus might also have Wi-Fi hotspots that aren't secured properly either.
We can use technology built into the phones (and therefore Smart Dust) to determine how easy it can
be to find these security holes.

#### Other solutions?

We might be able to use the GPS data if we're very lucky or very intelligent about what information
we try to look for.
